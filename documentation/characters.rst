Characters animations
=====================

Sprites per scanline
--------------------

Animation frames should not have more than 4 sprites per scanline to not hit the limit (of 8) when both characters are on the same height.

Animations can occasionally place more than 4 sprites per scanline, but make it fast to come back to a compliant state.

Special case: the idle animation should not have more than 3 sprites per scanline, to limit its impact on stage's elements.


Constraints on netload routines
===============================

* ``A``: output: Can be modified
* ``X``: output: Can be modified, input: Contains player number
* ``Y``: output: Must be incremented by character's payload size, input: offset of character's data in current message
* ``player_number``: output: Cannot be modified, input: Contains player number

Constraints on tick routines
============================

Registers
---------

* ``A``: output: Can be modified
* ``X``: output: Cannot be modified, input: Contains player number
* ``Y``: output: Can be modified
* ``player_number``: output: Can be modified, input: not ensured to be set
* ``tmpfields``: Can be modified
* ``extra_tmpfields``: To be checked

Constraints on start routines
=============================

Tick routines constraints generally apply, as start routines are often called from a tick routine

* ``A``: output: Can be modified
* ``X``: output: cannot be modified
* ``Y``: output: Can be modified
* ``player_number``: output: to be checked, input: not ensured to be set
* ``tmpfields``: Can be modified
* ``tmpfield15``: Used by aerial input code, aerial attacks should not modify it (or {char_name}_check_aerial_inputs should be fixed to use the stack/extra tmpfields)
* ``extra_tmpfields``: To be checked

Constraints on input routines
=============================

* ``A``: output: Can be modified
* ``X``: output: Cannot be modified, input: Contains player number
* ``Y``: output: Can be modified
* ``player_number``: output: Can be modified, input: not ensured to be set
* ``tmpfields``: Can be modified
* ``extra_tmpfields``: To be checked

Constraints on onhurt routines
==============================

Registers
---------

* ``A``: output: Can be modified, input: garbage
* ``X``: output: Can be modified, input: player number
* ``Y``: output: Can be modified, input: garbage
* ``player_number``: output: to be checked if can be modified, input: to be checked if ensured to be good
* ``tmpfield10``: output: cannot be modified, input: Player number of the striker
* ``tmpfield11``: output: cannot be modified, input: Player number of the stroke (equal to register X)
* ``tmpfield12``: output: can be modified, input: default hurt routine lsb
* ``tmpfield13``: output: can be modified, input: default hurt routine msb
* ``tmpfield14``: output: can be modified, input: default hurt routine bank
* ``other tmpfields``: output: can be modified, input garbage

``default_hurt_player`` routine is a helper to call the default hurt routine from fixed bank.

Dev note: The default routine is for handling custom hitboxes and projectiles calling the onhurt routine of the opponent without setting the striker's hitbox value. Maybe we can simplify things by passing a pointer to hitbox data, allowing constant hitboxes in ROM or dynamic ones in RAM without messing with engine-controlled ``player_*_hitbox_*`` variables.

Constraints on onground routines
================================

Constraints on offground routines
=================================

Constraints on global tick routines
===================================

* ``A``: output: Can be modified, input: garbage
* ``X``: output: Cannot be modified, input: player number
* ``Y``: output: Can be modified, input: garbage
* ``player_number``: output: can be modified, input: garbage

Constraints on projectile hit routines
======================================

* ``A``: output: Can be modified, input: garbage
* ``X``: output: Cannot be modified, input: projectile owner's player number
* ``Y``: output: Can be modified, input: hitbox type
* ``player_number``: output: can be modified, input: garbage

Custom hitboxes
===============

Most of the time you'd want to use direct hitbox, containing knockback and damage info to be handled automatically by the engine.

In some case, you may need more flexibility and here comes the custom hitbox. It is defined by setting hitbox enabled byte to ``2`` (instead of ``1`` for direct hitboxes), and a routine pointer in place of knockback parameters.

Constraints on the callback
---------------------------

* ``A``: output: Can be modified, input: Garbage
* ``X``: output: Can be modified, input: Player number
* ``Y``: output: Can be modified, input: Type of the collided object (``HITBOX`` or ``HURTBOX`` defined in global constants)
* ``player_number``: output: Can be modified, input: Not ensured to be set
* ``tmpfields``: output: can be modified, input: Garbage

When ``Y`` is set to ``HITBOX`` the callback is responsible for consequences of the collision:

* On the character it controls,
* On the opponent if the opponent's hitbox is direct.

Direct hitboxes will not apply parry to their opponent when colliding to a custom hitbox.

Note that if both hitboxes are custom, only avatar A's callback will be called. If it causes issues it should be changed to ensure character code has only to care about itself in hitbox vs hitbox scenario.

Memory allocation
=================

* ``$00`` -> ``$69``: Avatar state
* ``$0480`` -> ``$04ff``: Avatar objects
* ``$0600`` -> ``$0641``: Avatar projectiles

Avatar state
------------

The engine maintains all avatars state variables in an interleaved table in zero-page from $0000 to $0069. These variables are named ``player_a_*`` and ``player_b_*``, and often accessed by setting player's number in register X and using it as an index from ``player_a_xxx`` variant of the variable.

Most of these variables have specific meaning for the engine and are to be updated accordingly by character's code. Some are free to use for character-specific logic:

* ``player_x_state_fieldN``: automatically restored by netcode, action templates may use it.
* ``player_x_state_extraN``: character's netcode is responsible of it, action templates do not use it.

Avatar objects
--------------

Character code can also manipulate 64 bytes of linear memory. These regions are named ``player_a_objects`` and ``player_b_object``, and are not interleaved. The engine interprets data in these regions as a list of avatar-independent "ojects" of different types.

Object types:

* STAGE_ELEMENT_END
* STAGE_ELEMENT_PLATFORM
* STAGE_ELEMENT_SMOOTH_PLATFORM
* STAGE_ELEMENT_OOS_PLATFORM
* STAGE_ELEMENT_OOS_SMOOTH_PLATFORM
* STAGE_ELEMENT_BUMPER

The engine does not read data after the byte indentifying a STAGE_ELEMENT_END. The memory after this byte can be freely used by character code.

Avatar projectiles
------------------

Character code can manipulate some projectiles per avatar. These are stored in variables ``player_a_projectiles_N_xxx`` and ``player_b_projectile_N_xxx``, and are interleaved between players. Where ``N`` is the projectile number.

Useful constants:

* PROJECTILE_FLAGS_DEACTIVATED
* PROJECTILE_DATA_SIZE
* NB_PROJECTILES_PER_PLAYER

Projectiles are zero-initialized at the begining of the game, then never write again by the engine. Maintaining it and trasfering it in netcode's state is the responsibility of character's implementation.
